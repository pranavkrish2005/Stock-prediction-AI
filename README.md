# Stock-prediction-AI

## Project Description

A deep learning pipeline designed to perform stock forecasting forecasting. It leverages various machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures to predict stock prices 1 day in advance given the stock closing price of the last 5 days of the Stock SPY, tracking the S&P 500.

### Key technologies used
The AI in this code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for predicting stock prices. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer are used for training. The AI utilizes historical stock prices to learn patterns and make predictions. Additionally, the code incorporates data manipulation with pandas and data visualization using Matplotlib to visualize the predicted stocks.

## Results
After 100 epochs, the AI can predict the stock price of SPY with a mean absolute error of 5.2589.
